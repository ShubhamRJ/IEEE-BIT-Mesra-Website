        Practical application of the knowledge gained during engineering is what a to-be engineer should seek. Keeping this in mind, we at IEEE BIT Mesra initiated a new event called 'The Mega-Project'. 
        <br>So, what is this exactly?<br>
        Every member of IEEE Student Chapter BIT MESRA chooses one topic pertaining to his field of interest and tries to make a working project of the problem. The problem can be making a robot to making a website etc. This can be done individually or in groups of maximum 3. They get a time span of about 3 to 4 months after which the Project Symposium is conducted where the groups present their projects. The best projects are awarded.
        This initiative helps students make projects which is very important as well as useful during engineering as well as gives a sense of accomplishment.</p>
