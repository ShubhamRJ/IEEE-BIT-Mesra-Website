            IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) Student's Chapter BIT Mesra believes in a constant
            endeavour to inculcate among students the requisite knowledge to catch up with their peers across the
            global community and most importantly, tomorrow. The club ensures this through quality workshops on
            contemporary topics, and through events which are aimed at sharpening cognition among participants and
            organizers alike. At IEEE, we believe in disseminating what we know and learning what we don't.
            IEEE Global and its members aim at a better tomorrow through its more than 420,000 members in over 160
            countries, and its highly cited publications, conferences, technology standards, and professional and
            educational activities.
